# landing-page-website
A landing page website is a single web page designed with a focused objective, typically used in marketing campaigns to capture a visitor’s attention and encourage a specific action — such as:

Signing up for a newsletter

Downloading an app or resource

Registering for an event

Making a purchase

Key Characteristics of a Landing Page Website:
Single Purpose: Unlike full websites with multiple sections, a landing page focuses on one goal.

Minimal Navigation: Usually has little to no menu options to avoid distractions.

Strong Call-to-Action (CTA): Prominent buttons or forms like “Sign Up,” “Buy Now,” or “Learn More.”

Targeted Messaging: Content is tailored to a specific audience or campaign.

Visual Appeal: Clean, engaging design to keep attention and build trust.

Lead Capture Form: Often includes a form to gather user info like name, email, or phone number.

Common Use Cases:
Product launches

Ad campaigns (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, etc.)

Event promotions

E-book or whitepaper downloads
